RE + CE
#######

F5XC can provide additional capabilities by expanding the F5XC directly into the customer datacenter.

This is done by installing an VM/Baremetal device, F5XC Customer Edge ( CE ) in the datacenter. 

This allows us to send the traffic to the application through an IPSEC tunnel and also provide internal, external load balancing and security services.

Now we will send the traffic directly to the backend servers without any need of publishing the application on the internet.
