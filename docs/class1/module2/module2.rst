######################################

In this section, we will expose an existing and public internet facing application through F5XC Global Network.

The use case is simple:

* An application is already up and running somewhere (Datacenter, public cloud ...)
* This application has a public IP address or FQDN
* We will euse and levrage the F5XC Global Network to expose this application
* The application will be available everywhere though all F5XC Regional Edge locations
* We will apply a WAAP policy
